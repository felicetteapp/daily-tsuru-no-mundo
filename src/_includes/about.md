## About

**Tsuru No Mundo** was born by chance in **early 2016**. Since then, I have been **photographing origami** cranes in various landscapes. Over the years, I have had the good fortune to do this in places like **Argentina, Chile, Brazil, Uruguay, Portugal, Spain, France, the Netherlands, Germany, and Turkey**. I don't travel as much as I would like, but whenever I have the chance, I do, and I take the opportunity to continue this project.

### The daily project

**Tsuru No Mundo: Daily** is a _spin-off_ designed to keep me connected with origami, even when I'm not traveling (which is most of the time). **The idea is simple:** to force myself to take breaks during the day, step away from my phone and computer, and **engage in something manual** in the physical world.
